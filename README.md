This is a clone of one of my favorite games, 2048, that I built from scratch as a side project.

The goal is to add up blocks until you reach 2048 by using the arrow keys. Once you can no longer move any blocks, you lose. 

This project was built with JavaScript & Sass using webpack and babel.

This game is currently designed to be played on desktop only.

Instructions:
- npm install
- npm start
