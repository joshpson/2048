      <p>This is a clone of one of my favorite games, 2048, that I built from scratch as a side project. The goal is to add up blocks until you reach 2048 by using the arrow keys. Once you can no longer move any blocks, you lose. <br><br>

      This project was built with webpack & babel using JavaScript & Sass. <strong><a href="https://github.com/joshpson/2048">Github</a></strong>.</p>
